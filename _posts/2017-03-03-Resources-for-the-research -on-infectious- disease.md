# RRID
RRID is a repository that includes the resources for the research on infectious disease. Majority of the resources focus on **Infectious Respiratory Diseases** and **Vector-borne Disease** (i.e. [Influenza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza), [Mumps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mumps), [Dengue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza) and [Zika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zika)). Resources were classified as four parts: **public datasets**, **software packages** , **famious labs**, **risk assessment** and **public codes**.
