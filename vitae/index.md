## Computer Skills

I like playing with computer tools for building web pages and statistical computation & graphics. I improve the efficiency of my work with the aid of programming (i.e. work hard to be lazy).

- Statistical software: [R](http://www.r-project.org/), [GIS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system)
- Languages: R, HTML, JavaScript
- Applications: [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/), [LyX](http://www.lyx.org)

Listed above are what I'm very familiar with, and the ones being crossed out are due to my brain stack overflow and I do garbage collection in my brain once in a while.
