You can know more about me in the [homepage](/) and my [vitae](../vitae/). This blog site, as its name indicates, is about statistics, R, graphics and fun. It is particularly focused on R.  
This site was created with [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) and the template was derived from the site [setImpl](http://lhzhang.com/) by Linghua Zhang; the homepage was based on the design of [Tao Zhang](http://ztpala.com/) (thanks a lot, guys!). You may need a decent web browser to view this site (such as Firefox or Chrome), otherwise the layout can be a mess and the fonts can look ugly. You can navigate to the last post by the left-arrow key (`<-`) or next post by right-arrow (`->`), or equivalently keys `J` and `K`.

I like contributing to open source software like:

- [R](http://www.r-project.org/): Spatial Analysis and Data Visualization
- [Latex](http://www.latex-project.org/): High-quality typesetting system

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/Spatial-R). Subscribe to the RSS feed of [blog posts](../feed/) or [all comments](https://disqus.com/spatialr/) to stay tuned.
